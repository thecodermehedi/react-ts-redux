// Function Currying Concept
//! Currying Function helps remember the reference of the outer function scope by keeping it in the closure

const add = (a: number) => {
 return (b: number) => {
  return (c: number) => {
   return a + b + c;
  }
 }
}

console.log(add(2)(3)(4)); // Output: 9

//* Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument.

//* Instead of taking all arguments at once, the curried function takes the first argument, returns a new function that takes the next argument, and so on until all arguments are provided.The final function then returns the result.

//* In simpler terms, currying breaks down a function that takes multiple parameters into a chain of functions that each take one parameter.

//*  Note: An American mathematician named Haskell Curry developed this technique, thatâ€™s why it is called currying.

//? Currying offers several advantages, especially when working with functional programming patterns:

//? It helps us to create a higher - order function

//? It reduces the chances of error in our function by dividing it into multiple smaller functions that can handle one responsibility.

//? It is very useful in building modular and reusable code

//? It helps us to avoid passing the same variable multiple times

//? It makes the code more readable
